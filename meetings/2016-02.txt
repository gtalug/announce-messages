# Raspberry Pi Projects and Lighting Talks

To start off the meeting we have two ten minute talks about using the Raspberry Pi in interesting ways:

* Alex Volkov's Over-Enginerring of a Flower Pot using a Raspberry Pi.
* Mike Kalles's using a Raspberry Pi for Intrusion Detection.

After Alex's and Mike's talk there will be a bunch of audience organised short talks. If you would like to give a talk, all you have to do is write your name on a post-it and stick it on the whiteboard in the front of the room. When your talk get's picked you will have five minutes of uninterrupted time for you to present, then five minutes of audience questions/concerns.

# Code of Conduct

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas, improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.
