# Behind and Beyond Maker Festival with Eric Boyd

I'm Eric Boyd, founder of maker festival, and serial entrepreneur. I grew up on a
small farm in Ontario, and I've lived and worked in Silicon Valley. I co-founded
StumbleUpon.com with friends in 2000, and in Toronto I've been president of
Hacklab.TO, organizer of lots of different meetups (including Toronto Quantified
Self). My interests span everything from technology to economics to leadership
to gardening to cooking to travel.

I'll talk about Maker Festival, why we do it, how we do, and what the impacts
have been.

Maker Festival brings together Torontoâ€™s most creative people and projects, in
order to inspire openness to possibilities, a sense of active participation in
shaping our world, and a yearning for a more wonder-filled tomorrow. Makers of
all types (electronics, robotics, sewing, paper crafting, glowy things, etc.etc)
exhibit their DIY work and share their enthusiasm with the public. I'm happy to
talk more broadly about technology and people.

# Code of Conduct

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas, improve every
process every year, and foster collaboration between individuals with differing
needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from those who
enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that diverse groups
collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will challenge prejudice that
could jeopardise the participation of any person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private whenever the
Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect it to be honoured by
everyone who represents the community officially or informally, claims
affiliation or participates directly. It applies to activities online or
offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about the GTALUG Code of
Conduct please contact the GTALUG Board @ <board@gtalug.org>.
