# Building a 3D printer from scratch with Alex Volkov

Building a 3D printer from scratch may be easier than making an apple pie from scratch! In this talk Alex will talk about getting into 3D printing 'the hard way' by building a clone of Prusa i3 MK2 from scratch using bits of wood, some metric hardware, arduino, 3D-printer and 3D printed parts, then attempting to design and print.

# Code of Conduct

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas, improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will challenge prejudice that could jeopardise the participation of any person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect it to be honoured by everyone who represents the community officially or informally, claims affiliation or participates directly. It applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.
