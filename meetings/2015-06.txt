# GPG Key-Signing Party and Round Table Q&A Session

See the bottom of this email for instructions on the GPG Key-Signing Party.

A Round Table Q&A Session is where we take questions from the audience, and the audience discusses and attempts to answer those questions from their own knowledge. It's a great way to meet fellow members of our community and discover the skill sets we each bring to the table.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

# Code of Conduct

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas, improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

Please read more about the GTALUG Code of Conduct here: <http://gtalug.org/about/code-of-conduct/>.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about the GTALUG Code of Conduct please contact the GTALUG Board @ <board@gtalug.org>.

# GPG Key-Signing Party

1. Create an OpenPGP keypair for yourself (if you haven't) already.

2. Print or write down your key fingerprint and bring it with you. You'll have to confirm at the signing that the list is correct for your key.

3. Send your public key before the event to the `pgp.mit.edu` keyserver.

4. Bring a goverment-issued picture ID of yourself.

### At the Key Signing Party

1. Each participant should meet up face to face with every other participant to receive their key fingerprint and examine their ID, and to give them your key fingerprint and have them examine your ID.

2. Each participant should meet up face to face with every other participant to receive their key fingerprint and examine their ID, and to give them your key fingerprint and have them examine your ID.

### After the Key Signing Party

1. Find the key ID on the fingerprint. The fingerprint will have an 8-character ID listed after the key size. Typically it looks like this: '1024D/64011A8B'. The actual ID portion is the '64011A8B'. You'll notice this is also the last 8 characters of the fingerprint itself.

2. Fetch the public key using the key ID. If you're running GnuPG on the command line, you can do this by typing: `gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys <KeyID>` (where KeyID is obviously the ID of the key you want).

3. Check that the fingerprint of the key you've just fetched matches the fingerprint on the slip of paper: `gpg --fingerprint <KeyID>` and compare it with the hard copy in front of you.

4. If (and only if) you are happy that the fingerprints match and the person showed you sufficient ID, you can do the actual 'signing' part of the process: `gpg --sign-key <KeyID>` and answer the questions it asks.

5. Next you need to send the signed copy of their key back to them. Now upload the signed key back to the server `gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-key <Key_ID>`. You should get back something like 'gpg: sending key <Key_ID> to hkp server pgp.mit.edu'.

### Help

Get your KEYID from your keyring as the part following the 1024D/ as follows:

    gpg --list-secret-keys | grep sec

Here is how to send your key to the keyserver:

    gpg --keyserver gpg.mit.edu --send-keys <KEYID>

Get your fingerprint information:

    gpg --fingerprint KEYID
