# Intelligent Availability; The evolution of High Availability with Alex Bruneau

Alex will discuss the tenants of and concepts behind "Intelligent Availability" and how it provides "next gen" availability. The "Anvil!" platform is the first full IA platform, combining a fully redundant architecture along with the 100% open source Striker UI and ScanCore "decision engine". A live demonstration of this platform will be used to show IA in action. Various faults will be induced, showing how the Anvil! autonomously reacts to mitigate these changing risks.

Attendees will be learn how to apply these IA techniques and concepts, allowing them to make their own IT environments more resilient.

Alex Bruneau is the head of customer support at Alteeve.

Alteeve is the company of Esteemed Community Member, Madison Kelly.

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas, improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will challenge prejudice that could jeopardise the participation of any person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect it to be honoured by everyone who represents the community officially or informally, claims affiliation or participates directly. It applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.
