# Call for Lightning Talks

Lighting Talks is GTALUG's version of an un-conference, loosely structured short
talks emphasizing the informal exchange of information and ideas between
participants. A change of pace, rather than following a conventionally
structured GTALUG meetings.

If you would like to give a talk, all you have to do is write your name on a
post-it and stick it on the whiteboard in the front of the room. When your talk
get's picked you will have five uninterrupted minutes for you to present your
idea, then five minutes of audience questions.

If you'd like to have slides or additional time, or just know you have something
ready, please lets know in advance.  Contact us at speakers@gtalug.org
