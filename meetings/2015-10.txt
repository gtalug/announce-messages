### Linux on Enterprise 64-bit ARM Platforms _with Chris Tyler_

A new architecture has arrived! 64-bit ARM promises high-performance, low-energy, extremely dense server computing systems. This is the first time in the history of computing that a major architecture has launched with Linux as the premier operating system. This talk will discuss the hard challenges presented by the Aarch64 architecture and the opportunities it creates.

# Code of Conduct

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas, improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.
